## üìò Project Overview

This project implements a **data-driven pricing strategy** to help businesses set prices that maximize revenue. By analyzing historical sales, competitor pricing, and temporal patterns, the system predicts demand under varying price points and identifies the most profitable pricing decisions.

Workflow Description
1. Data Preparation
Import raw data files containing past transactions, prices, and competitor benchmarks.

Clean inconsistencies, handle missing entries, and normalize columns.

2. Feature Engineering
Generate variables capturing seasonality (e.g., month, weekday).

Calculate lagged demand metrics and relative price positioning.

Encode categorical fields for model compatibility.

3. Demand Prediction
Train regression models to estimate demand based on price and other predictors.

Evaluate model performance using R¬≤ and error metrics.

Select the model with the highest predictive accuracy.

4. Pricing Optimization
Simulate a range of possible prices.

Use the trained model to forecast demand at each price point.

Compute projected revenue (price √ó predicted demand).

Identify the price that yields the highest expected revenue.

5. Recommendations Output
Generate reports summarizing optimal prices and expected outcomes.

Visualize demand curves and revenue simulation
